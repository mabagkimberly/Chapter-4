# Chapter-4
Creating Project Themplate
* I learned how to better organize my Flutter project by creating folders and grouping files based on their types.
This approach helps keep the project structured and manageable as it grows. For example,
I can create separate folders for assets, models, and screens, making it easier to navigate the project.

*The chapter also taught me how to separate and structure widgets into different files. 
By splitting widgets into their own files, I can improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
This modular approach allows for easier updates and debugging, as each widget is contained in its own specific file. 
Overall, this chapter emphasized the importance of a clean and organized project structure to streamline development and collaboration.
